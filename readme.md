# BotOS

BEHOLD! From the ashes of the 2019 BotOS project, a new BotOS has risen!

## What is BotOS?

The main objective of BotOS is to allow developers to create, extend, tweak and deploy cross-platform bots with ease.

It also aims to provide a simple way for community managers to set up their own botnets to moderate their communities, independently from the platform they are on.
